# Project Name: Bike Sharing Assignment
> This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## Table of Contents
* [General Info]
Business Goals :
We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

* [Technologies Used]
- pandas - version '1.3.4'
- numpy - version '1.20.3'
- matplotlib - version '3.4.3'
- seaborn - version '0.11.2'
- statsmodels- version '0.12.2'
- sklearn- version '0.24.2'

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- What is the background of your project?
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
We need to answer two questions for the company:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
The Top 3 features contributing significantly towards the demands of share bikes are:
â€¢ weathersit_Light_Snow(negative correlation).
â€¢ yr_2019(Positive correlation).
â€¢ temp(Positive correlation).

- What is the dataset that is being used?
day.csv

## Conclusions
Company can continue with the stratergy used in 2019.
They can offer a special discount on holidays for public to use bikes over other sevices.
windspeed is a factor which can't be controlled by the company, so they can think another possible way to overcome this issue.
They can offer coupons in spring season to encourage public to use bikes.
Rainy weather is the most affecting weather for the comapny as people avoid going out on bikes in rainy season.
Company should focus on expanding business during September.
Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to   2019.
There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to service the bikes without having business impact.
